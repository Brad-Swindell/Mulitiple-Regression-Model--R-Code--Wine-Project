# Mulitiple-Regression-Model-with-R-Code--Wine-Project

This is a project from the NoVa Data School, using a wine quality rating based on several input variables.  R Programming Code was used to analyze the data, set up a Multiple Regression Model, and solve the problem.  The import from R Studio to GitHub here was not very clean; other code projects here use Jupyter Notebooks and Python programming code.
