# Mulitiple-Regression-Models-with-R-Code---Wine-Project

This is a project from the NoVa Data School, using a wine quality rating based on several input variables.  R Code was used to set up a Multiple Regression Model and R programming to analyze and solve the problem.  The import from R Studio to GitHub here was not very clean, but I will be using Jupyter Notebooks and Python programming going forwad.
